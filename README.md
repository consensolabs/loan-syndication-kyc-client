# The Loan syndication client web application
The web app will communicate with the CorDapp built using [https://github.com/koshikraj/loan-syndication](https://github.com/koshikraj/loan-syndication). It is a private project for now. You can use the [this](http://projects.koshikraj.com:8888/api/) RPC end point or downloan and run the corda nodes locally from [this](http://jenkins.consensolabs.com:8080/job/deploy-syndlend-corda-nodes/) Jenkins artifacts.


## Quick Start

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
